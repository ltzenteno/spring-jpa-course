### Flyway

- use JPA Buddy to create diff migrations (show DDL... option, then copy it inside a new `sql` migration file) üëç

_NOTE: careful with how it creates DDL, `id` must be of type `SERIAL` instead of `INT`_


- To check migration info (which have been applied, which are pending):

      ./gradlew flywayInfo

- To run new migrations

      ./gradlew flywayMigrate -i
